				<h4>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?</h4>
        <p>I am an avid podcast listener and have started listening to a larger
        number of podcasts that delve in social, political and economic issues.
        I believe that there is a need for increased conversations around these
        topics and at the same time an easier way to discover new episodes or
        podcasts for users. This project focuses on researching and proposing a
        design to enable better podcasts discovery and to increase the
        conversations happening around the topics being covered.</p>

				<h4>PODCAST DEMOGRAPHICS</h4>
        <p>The first step in researching the requirements, I found existing
        research regarding the podcasts demographics focused on the US
        [1][2][3]. A recent study found that 21% of Americans above the age of
        12 have heard a podcast within the last month [2]. Diving deeper into
        these statistics one can see that 38% of podcast listeners in the US are
        between the ages of 18-34 [2]. This shows that younger individuals are
        more likely to listen to podcasts since only 28% of the US population
        above the age of 12 lies between the age group 18-34 [2]. Despite the
        higher skew towards the younger population, 34% of podcast listeners are
        between the ages of 35-54 whereas about 17% is 55+ [2]. This spread is a
        good indication of the age group demographics of the podcast listeners
        and shows that people from various age groups are listeners. Similarly
        looking at the demographics of the listeners, one can see the spread
        shown by podcast audience tends to follow the general US demographics as
        shown in the figure below [image in [1]]. Also an interesting thing to
        note approximately 50% of listeners have a bachelorâ€™s or higher degree.
        <br> 
        Another important aspect to study is where people listen to podcasts.
        According to research  conducted, half the listeners listen while at
        home [2]. The next highest proportion of listeners listen in a car or
        while driving [2]. Other common places include the gym [1], public
        transport [2] and at work [2].

				<h4>PERSONA DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        The following personas were developed using user interviews [link] along
        with personal experience being an avid podcast lister. The images used
        for the persona where obtained from
        <i>https://randomuser.me/photos</i>.<br><br>
        <p><b>Persona 1: John Smith (21 years old)</b><br>
        <img class="persona" src="assets/img/podcast-persona-1.png"><br><br>
        John Smith is 21 years old and a student at the University of Waterloo.
        John loves to listen to podcasts during his commute (walking or bussing)
        to and from school and while driving. John has an extensive list of
        podcasts he follows but he is constantly looking to explore more shows
        or even more topics. John is extremely interested in podcasts such as
        Reveal which tend to focus on investigative journalism from topics
        ranging from the american prison system to the state of welfare in US
        etc. While listening to such podcats, John wants to be able to find a
        place to have discussions about these topics with other listeners
        especially the ones that disagree with his point of view. Due to his
        interest in podcasts, John tends to listen to episodes over a longer
        period of time due to the short commute times in his daily routine. 
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Persona 2: Female name(50 years old)</b><br>
        <img class="persona" src="assets/img/podcast-persona-2.png"><br><br>
        Name is 50 years old and is an occasional podcast listener. The podcast
        Serial caused her to start listening to some episodes. She commutes an
        hour each way to work throughout the week and she tends to listen to
        podcasts while on the bus or her car. She currently relies on her
        children to recommend new episodes or setup the podcast app on her
        phone. She is experienced using her phone but she does not read websites
        or forums like reddit or twitter and is having a hard time finding new
        podcasts to follow. She wants a simple application to listen to podcasts
        and an easy way to get recommendations for new shows or episodes. 
        <br><br>

        <b>Persona 3: Male name (21 years old)</b><br>
        <img class="persona" src="assets/img/podcast-persona-3.png"><br><br>
        Name is a 21 year old student at the University of Waterloo. Unlike
        John, he is not overly interested in podcasts but enjoys and appreciates
        the medium. He listened to all episodes of Serial in quick succession
        and following that attempted to listen to technology focused podcasts
        but could not keep up with them. Name is interested in the idea of
        listening to more shows but considers himself a completionist and thus
        needs the episodes to be short enough to consume on his daily commute.
        Apart from the length, he does not like the scheduled nature of the
        shows because he feels like he is building a backlog within his
        application and is unable to keep up with it making him demotivated.
        Name would enjoy listening to new shows based on not only his interests
        but also his willingness to commit a certain amount of time.
