				<h4>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?</h4>
        <p>For the past 4 months I along with my team have been working on
        developing our capstone project. The project is focusing on developing a
        machine learning system to detect any intrusion attempts into a network
        by focusing on host based intrusion detection. In recent years, there
        have been significant security breaches such as the Yahoo hack and thus
        this project is particularly important. As part of a project we are
        working with a security company based in Toronto which acts as advisors.
        To build the actual system we are using a publically available dataset.
        This post focuses on the design of the front end user interface. Certain
        user interviews were conducted along with my team but all conclusions
        made, and any design decisions made are my own and are being used for
        the purposes of SYDE 542.</p>

				<h4>WHAT SKILLS EXPLORED?</h4>
        <p>This post focuses on the utilization of user interviews, literature
        review/research and designing information hierarchies (using card
        sorting). All the raw data and notes are available at ________. This
        post focuses more on the results from these design processes and their
        impact on any designs proposed.</p>

				<h4>CONDUCTING USER INTERVIEWS</h4>
        <p>Due to the complex nature of the product being built, the number of
        users accessible to me in order to interview were fairly limited. Due to
        this, I heavily relied on interviews conducted with a colleague with
        experience working in network security (Huzaifa), a colleague with
        experience working for a security startup and as a machine learning
        specialist (Erik) and lastly our industry contact at Lyrical Security
        (Chyaim). Due to the diverse background of the users being interviewed,
        each interview focused on slightly different aspects of the product.
        Interviews with Huzaifa and Chayim focused heavily on the type of data
        required by network and security specialists whereas the interview with
        Erik was far more focused on developing trust between users and a
        machine learning system due to his experience building ML systems at
        500px. Apart from these interviews I also relied on some of my
        experiences working as an Software Infrastructure Engineer at Shopify in
        order to note features required by infrastructure engineers in order to
        deploy and maintain such a system. </p>

				<h4>LITTERATURE RESEARCH AND REVIEW?</h4>
        <p>In order to better understand the implications of such a system
        review there was extensive research done regarding the machine learning
        aspect of the system. For the purposes of this post, I will only focus
        on literature review done for UI aspect of the project. There was a
        recent paper published by a team from the University of Toronto about
        “Adapting Level of Detail in User Interfaces for Cyber Security
        Operations” [<a href="google.com">link</a>]. The paper talks about building a user interface
        particularly aimed at delivering large amounts of data with minimal
        added cognitive workload for security operators.The paper focuses on the
        importance of adapting the level of detail the information is displayed
        on the basis of user actions and motives. For the purposes of the paper
        this is being done by developing machine learning models to
        automatically adjust the level of detail based on user actions. Instead
        of relying on machine learning, my proposed UI relies on giving the user
        the ability to change the level of detail based on their needs. This is
        done using manual interactions to make sure the UI behaves consistently
        and to promote user trust in the system. The reason machine learning was
        not incorporated into the front end was based on an interview conducted
        with a machine learning colleague of mine and his personal experience
        which people’s apprehensions about ML systems in a working environment.
